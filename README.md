This application is my first attempt to use Clean Architecture in Android development.
It uses pure Java - no Kotlin, no Rx at all. Also I've used some stuff from
Android Architecture Components - ViewModels and LifecycleObserver.

Below are some links to resources that I tried to understand the essence of Clean Architecture.
Perhaps they will help you too.
